Initially, we had various conflicts due to various task hours, class timings, medical history that does not allow one member to have long hours of computer screen time. 

## Meeting Info
After first discussion, We easily managed to work our way through the different schedule conflicts since both members are roommates and decided to start work on the phase 1 of the project for CS4540.

### Meeting 1 (21 September 2022)
 1. Agenda of the meeting   : Coming up with a project idea
 2. Location of the meeting : Housing Apartment
 3. Time span of the meeting: 10:30 - 11:30 pm
- The first project idea we decided on was Speechify, using Text to Speech technology to convert webpage text to audio.
- Aimed at helping users who prefer to listen content instead of hearing, people with dsylexia or other learning disabilities, children learning to read.
- Researched about the topic and looked into the necessary technology skills required to achieve it.
- Conclusion : We found the topic interesting and doable but not within the given time frame with several other work commitments for both students.
- Decided to pursue another idea we called as Docket (To- Do list).

### Meeting 2 (26 September 2022)
 1. Agenda of the meeting   : Discussion about Docket
 2. Location of the meeting : Zoom call
 3. Time span of the meeting: 2:30 - 4:00 pm
- Discussion about how Docket will help the majority of web users that like to organize, plan ahead, or want to do something later but don't want to forget about it.
- Common concept used by people but mostly by writing it down. Docket will save them time, space and energy.
- Researched into the necessary tools required to build this project within the given time frame.
- Discussion about which group member will work on what part of the project for timely completion.
- Went through some existing to-do list apps or extension that exist to get a better knowledge of what to include in our project to provide users the best web browsing experience.
- Planned to have meetings twice a week in person in the upcoming months to work on the phase 2 of the project with regular communication between both the team members to clarify any doubts, disagreements.
- Conclusion : Committed on the topic Docket for our FireFox Extension project for CS 4540.

## Divison of work
