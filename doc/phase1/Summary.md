## Docket
The title of our project is Docket (To-do list / Checklist).

## Description 
While browsing, use this extension to organize one's work and life. It allows users to capture and order tasks as they come to mind. Also, remind deadlines and due dates with respective lists. It functions similarly to a simple to-do list and includes the following features:
- Create websites as tasks.
- Include a blog post in the list.
- Add something to the list.
- Add work tasks to monitor.
Remind users of upcoming deadlines and payments. Plan the day and finish tasks in the browser. Do not forget to check off completed tasks.

## Why Docket?
Docket is practical for people who like to organize, plan, or do something later but forget about it later. It functions as a simple to-do list, preferred by most organizations for neat and orderly work. Since it also serves as a reminder for deadlines. Docket helps users manage their tasks while online browsing, researching, studying, shopping, and other activities.

### User Reviews :
1. Great reminder tool! It saves the usage of sticky notes and the mess I used to make.
2. It saves me much time as I am on the browser all the time. Also, it becomes very easy to reference websites and add tasks straight away.

## Build Time
The Docket extension is built in three phases:
1. Design and Requirements.
2. Code and Development.
3. Customization and Appearance.

### Design and Requirements
The first step would be to design the architecture and research the workable requirements of a to-do list from similar extensions and APIs. This phase informs us about the required permissions, the structure of a To-Do List extension, working API knowledge, and the management of browser sites/tabs.

### Code and Development.
The second phase would involve working on the prototype extension's development. In this step, we apply our design knowledge to create an extension model that works with all the functionality mentioned. The majority of the code is written in this phase.

### Customization and Appearance.
In the last step, we work on the CSS and styles of the extension to make it fancy and easier to use. This phase helps release the final product with a simple appearance that is easy to use and compatible with most websites.

## Work Division
Since this group consists of two members, they work equally. With mutual help and coordination, all the phases should be feasible with the expertise of both team members.
