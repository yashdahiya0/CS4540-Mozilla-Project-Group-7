# The Mozilla Collaborative Curriculum, 
## Assignment 2: Making Progress On Our Goals.
In-class, November 10th, the 11th for those students with conflicts.
Introduction

In phase two of the project you will begin implementing the plug-in or extension you described in phase one, and demonstrate that you are making measurable progress towards your goal.

# Deliverables
## Live demo of what you've got.
Five to 10 minutes long. What have you got so far?
(it can't be "nothing" - I need to be able to install an addon, and see it working, even knowing it's a work in progress.)
Focused on showing your work to the class and your audience, both as a demo and as a set of artifacts in your repository.
Your audience may ask you a couple of questions during the demo.
Hint: No need for one talking head. It’s always an option to “pass the mic” to another team member.
## Technical Product Report
A markdown document in your repository -A2/product.md, with the following items:
Short report (4-8 min’ read)
What did you build during this phase?
High-level design of your software.
Technical highlights: interesting bugs, challenges, lessons learned, observations, etc.
Reflect on your teamwork and process. What worked well, what  needs improvement.
Triage: What will you build for the final demo?
Note: we're looking for a consistent story here - If you say, we did A and B, we tested X and Y, we tried Z but discarded the idea - so claims about work progress should be reflected by artefacts that are visible in your git repository. The easiest way to accomplish this, and not coincidentally the way we hope you'll approach this, is to check incremental work into your repositories early and often, especially if it's incomplete.
