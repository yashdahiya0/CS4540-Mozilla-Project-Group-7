## Version 0.1.0- 0.1.5
Starting from scratch, we built the base model files for Docket using the default template that has been provided. We than designed the HTML and CSS files along with the Javascript file for Docket. We than made certain changs in the model and design from the base model that we were using. We further worked on adding functionality to Docket. The functionality required a lot of work so we further improved the working of the functionality.
## Version 0.2.0 - 0.2.2
Next, we worked on finishing up the rough patches of the previous versions and worked on Docket to able to provide a finished prototype that enables half of the functionalities. We further added a clean up button which is able to remove data from the local storage and empty it. Worked on a bug error that resulted in mismatches. Cleaned up bugs for functionality.
