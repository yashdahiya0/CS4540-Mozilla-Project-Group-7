Initially, we had several conflicts due to different task hours, class times, and medical histories that prevented one member from spending long periods in front of a computer screen.

## Meeting Info
After the initial discussion, we easily worked our way through the various schedule conflicts because both members are roommates and decided to begin work on phase 1 of the project for CS4540.

### Meeting 1 (21 September 2022)
 1. Agenda of the meeting: Coming up with a project idea
 2. Location of the meeting: Housing Apartment
 3. Period of the meeting: 10:30 - 11:30 pm
- Our first project idea was Speechify, which uses Text to Speech technology to convert webpage text to audio. 
It- Intended to assist users who prefer to listen to content rather than hear it, people with dyslexia or other learning disabilities, and children learning to read. 
- Investigated the topic and the necessary technical skills required to achieve it. 
- Conclusion: We found the topic interesting and doable, but not within the time frame allotted because both students had other work commitments. 
- We decided to pursue another concept known as Docket (To- Do list).

### Meeting 2 (26 September 2022)
 1. Agenda of the meeting: Discussion about Docket
 2. Location of the meeting: Zoom call
 3. Period of the meeting: 2:30 - 4:00 pm
- A discussion of how Docket will benefit the vast majority of web users who like to organize, plan, or do something later but don't want to forget about it. 
- People use this concept frequently, but mostly by writing it down. They will save time, space, and energy by using Docket. 
- Investigated the tools required to complete this project within the time frame specified. 
- Discuss which group members will work on which parts of the project to complete on time. 
- I went through some existing to-do list apps or extensions to get a better idea of what to include in our project to provide the best web browsing experience for users.
- In the coming months, it is planned to hold in-person meetings twice a week to work on phase 2 of the project, with regular communication between both team members to clarify any doubts or disagreements. 
- Conclusion: Committed to the topic Docket for our CS 4540 Firefox Extension project.

## Divison of work
All current and future collaboration work will be handled via GitHub. 
For the various build phases of the project, the entire work is to be divided equally between both students: 
1. Design and specifications 
2. Development and Coding 
3. Personalization and Appearance
