## Build Time
The Docket extension would be built in three phases:
1. Design and Requirements.
2. Code and Development.
3. Customization and Appearance.

### Design and Requirements
First step would be to design the architecture and researching the working requirements of a todo list from similar extensions and API's. This phase gives us the information about Permissions required, Structure of a To Do List extension, working API knowledge and Broswer sites/tabs management.  

### Code and Development.
Second phase would be the working on the development of the prototype extension. In this step, we apply the knowledge gained in design and create a extension model which works with 100% functionality mentioned. Most of the coding is done here. 

### Customization and Appearance.
In the last step, we work on CSS and styles of the extension to make it fancy and easier to use. This is the phase that helps release the final product with a simple appearance that is easy to use and compatible with most websites.
