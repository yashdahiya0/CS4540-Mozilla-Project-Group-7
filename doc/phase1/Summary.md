Goal: Describe your project.

Make sure to elaborate clearly:
  What are you planning to build? Who are the users? And, why do you think users will find your software useful/valuable?
  How are you planning to build it?
    Ex: What are the different components of the system? What are some of the anticipated challenges? How will you divide the work?

Intended audience:
  Your TA/instructor expect to get a good understanding of your planned project, based on this document alone.
  Your team -- to make sure everybody is on the same page. 

In the next phase(s), you will be able to refer back to it when deciding how to prioritize work.
Your users - we need 2 to 3 convincing user stories, reasons that a person derive value from your software that believably link up to the product design.
