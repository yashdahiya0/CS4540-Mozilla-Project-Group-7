## Docket
The title of our project is Docket (To-do list / Check-list).

## Description 
While browsing, use this extension to organize your work and life. It allows users to capture and organize tasks as they come to mind. Also, remind deadlines and due dates with respective tasks. It functions similarly to a simple to-do list and includes the following features: 
- Create tasks for websites. 
- Include a blog post in your list. 
- Add something to your list. 
- Add work tasks to monitor. 
- Remind users of upcoming deadlines and payments. 

Plan your day and finish tasks in the browser. Don't forget to check off completed tasks.

## Why Docket?
Docket is useful for people who like to organize, plan ahead, or do something later but forget about it later. It functions as a simple to-do list, which is preferred by most organizations for neat and orderly work. Since it also serves as a reminder to not miss deadlines. Docket helps users manage their tasks while online browsing, doing research, studying, shopping, and other activities.

### User Reviews :
1.  Great reminder tool! Saves the usage of sticky notes and mess I used to make.  
2.  It saves me a lot of time as I am in the browser all the time. Also it becomes very easy to reference websites and add tasks straight away.

## Build Time
The Docket extension would be built in three phases:
1. Design and Requirements.
2. Code and Development.
3. Customization and Appearance.

### Design and Requirements
The first step would be to design the architecture as well as research the working requirements of a to-do list from similar extensions and APIs. This phase informs us about the required permissions, the structure of a To Do List extension, working API knowledge, and the management of browser sites/tabs.  

### Code and Development.
The second phase would involve working on the prototype extension's development. In this step, we apply our design knowledge to create an extension model that works with all of the functionality mentioned. The majority of the coding is done here.

### Customization and Appearance.
In the final step, we work on the extension's CSS and styles to make it more aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. This is the phase that contributes to the final product having a simple appearance that is easy to use and compatible with the majority of websites.

---------------------
## Work Division
Work would be divided equally among the two members of this group. With the expertise of both team members, all phases should be feasible with mutual assistance and coordination.
